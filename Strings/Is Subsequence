Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters 
without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        
        if(s.length() == 0) return true;
        
        int s_pointer = 0;
        int t_pointer = 0;
        
        while(t_pointer < t.length()){
            
            if(t.charAt(t_pointer) == s.charAt(s_pointer)) 
                s_pointer++;
            
            if(s_pointer==s.length()) return true;
            
            t_pointer++;
        }
        
        return false;
        
    }
}
